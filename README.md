# Introduction to the Cost-Efficient Home Automation System (CEHA)

The extensive use of electronic devices and ineffective energy management techniques are the main causes of the worlds rising energy consumption. This projects goal is to use the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V board to create a Cost-Effective IoT-Based Home Automation System in order to solve this problem. Users will be able to automate chores remotely operate household appliances and keep an eye on energy usage with this system which will ultimately improve comfort and convenience while cutting down on energy waste. The purpose of this project is to show how the RISC-V platform can be used to develop creative and reasonably priced smart home solutions by utilizing its open source nature and availability.


# Overview of (CEHA)
Designing and implementing a home automation system with the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V board as its central processing unit is the suggested solution. This system will smoothly incorporate a range of communication, actuators, and sensors. modules that make it possible to monitor and control household appliances. Notable features include energy consumption tracking, automation scheduling, remote operation, and security features. The system will be accessible to users through a user-friendly web interface or mobile application.

The major objective is to use the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V board to create an IoT-based home automation system that is both inexpensive and useful. For practical Internet of things applications this includes developing a system that can manage a range of household appliances and showcasing the RISC-V architectures affordability and capabilities.

This project has a number of important features and advantages:-
1) First off, the system is incredibly economical thanks to the open-source software and inexpensive VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V board. 
2) Second, because it is open-source, a wide range of devices and features can be integrated and customized. By enabling remote control of appliances, automating chores, and customizing comfort settings, it also improves user convenience. 3) Crucially, the system encourages energy efficiency with features like occupancy-based lighting control and smart thermostats. Lastly, it supports the expansion and advancement of the RISC-V ecosystem.
