# Key Features of the VSDSquadron Mini 

**Core Processor**


- The board is powered by CH32V003F4U6 chip with 32-bit RISC-V core based on RV32EC instruction set, which is optimized for high-performance computing providing support for 2-level interrupt pins and supports 24MHz system main clock frequency in the product function itself.

**Robust GPIO Support**


- It Boasts 3 groups of GPIO ports, totalling 15 I/O ports, which enables extensive peripheral connections to other pins and mapping it to the external interrupt capabilities as well.

**High-Speed Memory**


- The VSDQUADRON Mini Board is itself Equipped with 2KB SRAM for volatile data storage, 16KB CodeFlash for programming memory, and it's also providing the additional 1920B for bootloader functionalities.

**Clock and Reset Systems**


- It also Includes a built-in factory-trimmed 24MHz RC oscillator and a 128kHz RC oscillator, plus an external 24MHz oscillator option for variying clocking frequency requirements.



**Flexible Communication Interfaces**


- Offers multiple communication protocols including USART, I2C, and SPI to provide versatile connectivity options.

**On-board Programmer**


- It has a feature of Features on-board CH32V305FBP6 single-wire programming protocol, enhancing development efficiency with seamless code deployment and debugging.
