# Introduction to the Cost-Efficient Home Automation System (CEHA)

The extensive use of electronic devices and ineffective energy management techniques are the main causes of the worlds rising energy consumption. This projects goal is to use the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V board to create a Cost-Effective IoT-Based Home Automation System in order to solve this problem. Users will be able to automate chores remotely operate household appliances and keep an eye on energy usage with this system which will ultimately improve comfort and convenience while cutting down on energy waste. The purpose of this project is to show how the RISC-V platform can be used to develop creative and reasonably priced smart home solutions by utilizing its open source nature and availability.
